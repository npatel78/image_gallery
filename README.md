# CTEC 227 Spring 2021: Project 1 - Build an Image Gallery

## Student Responsibilities and Expectations

> Academic and intellectual honesty are the only acceptable behaviors. You are expected to do your own work on assignments, quizzes and projects. Lack of ethical behavior will result in receiving no credit on an activity, assignment or test, and may result in a final grade of "F" and/or dismissal from the course.

## Project Details

Using the PHP code examples provided in this module, **build a single page PHP application** that does the following:

- Allows a user to upload images, one at a time
- Displays the images on the page as a gallery
- Provides a link below each picture that allows you to delete the image from the gallery
- Style your page in a professional way. You should develop this lab to include in your portfolio of work.
- The use of Boostrap is optional. If you know Boostrap you should use it.
- You can use CSS Grid and Flexbox if you want.
- Push your code to GitHub once you have completed the assignment.
- Students will be demoing their projects to the class during the following the due date.
